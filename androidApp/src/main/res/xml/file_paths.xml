    FileProvider paths configuration for secure file sharing.

    This allows the app to share files from the cache directory via content:// URIs
    instead of file:// URIs, which is required for Android 7.0+ (API 24+).

    The cache-path element makes the app's cache directory available for sharing.
    Files placed in context.cacheDir can be shared using this provider.
